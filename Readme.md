### Description

**Gotta Scal'em All** - Optimize Unreal Scalability the Smart Way

Balancing Unreal's `DefaultScalability.ini` is often a grind: endless numbers, trial & error, spreadsheets, and lots of guesswork.
Scalem changes that. It's a dedicated editor window that lets you visualize, compare, and fine-tune scalability settings‚Äîbased on real data from your target machines.

No black magic. No AI buzzwords. Just clarity and control for your game's performance.

#### Why Scalem?

- **Save hours of trial & error** ‚Äì adjust values with intuitive sliders instead of juggling numbers.
- **Work with reality, not assumptions** ‚Äì fetch real performance data from the PCs that matter.
- **Experiment without risk** ‚Äì create and compare multiple scalability presets instantly.
- **Keep your pipeline clean** ‚Äì Scalem uses Unreal's native scalability system, nothing proprietary.
- **Get team alignment** ‚Äì no more subjective debates, just shared visual data.

#### What Scalem is not

- ‚ùå A magical "auto-optimize" button
- ‚ùå Another spreadsheet nightmare
- ‚ùå An AI tool that promises too much
